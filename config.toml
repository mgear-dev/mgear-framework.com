Softimage User will be delighted to find their favorite Rig Builder in Maya. Maya user will be amazed how MGear is solid and flexible. Gear has been used in production all around the world since 2010 and changed the life of many riggers and animators, I have no doubt that mGear will have the same success. Do I need to mention it’s free and open source ?&rdquo;"

  quote = "&ldquo;mGear has proven to be a stable, efficient solution for our rigging pipeline. It's flexible enough that we've used it on cartoony series such as Zafari, and also for game cinematics such as Ubisoft’s Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege.  It's very straightforward, so the learning curve isn't extremely steep for onboarding new artists, and there aren't a lot of clicks and/or steps to get you from template to build. This may seem inconsequential, but in a production environment where deadlines can be tight, this is quite essential. Under the hood, there's also  quite a number of attributes available that allow you adjust the rig to your needs. Miquel has been a delight to work with any time that we've had questions, or flagged concerns, and I really wouldn't hesitate to recommend this product to any studio or personal user. &rdquo;"

We look forward to every release as it just gets better and better with its on-going support. On our projects, the small rigging department is normally faced with a large number of unique characters to rig in a short space of time. mGear allows us to bring solid and time-tested rigs to our animators. mGear is our go-to solution for a fast and iterative rigging process. It's easy to learn and use and the potential of expanding Shifter with custom components using the mGear framework is an aspect we are very excited about.&rdquo;"
