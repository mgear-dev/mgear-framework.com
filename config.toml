Softimage User will be delighted to find their favorite Rig Builder in Maya. Maya user will be amazed how MGear is solid and flexible. Gear has been used in production all around the world since 2010 and changed the life of many riggers and animators, I have no doubt that mGear will have the same success. Do I need to mention it’s free and open source ?&rdquo;"

  quote = "&ldquo;Miquel did an absolutely stellar job in bringing what we loved about Gear in XSI to Maya with mGear. We look forward to every release as it just gets better and better with its on-going support. On our projects, the small rigging department is normally faced with a large number of unique characters to rig in a short space of time. mGear allows us to bring solid and time-tested rigs to our animators. mGear is our go-to solution for a fast and iterative rigging process. It's easy to learn and use and the potential of expanding Shifter with custom components using the mGear framework is an aspect we are very excited about.&rdquo;"

Being able to publish ready-to-animate rigs in a matter of minutes allowing time to refine & build upon the rigs without causing bottlenecks has been incredibly powerful. Building custom shifter components only opens up the possibilities even further! All the animators really enjoy working with the rigs from mGear, and we wouldn't be without it!&rdquo;"
